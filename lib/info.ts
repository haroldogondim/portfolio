    description: `
      At HP, I joined as a Senior Software Developer with over 10 years of experience in PHP, but no prior experience with Drupal. I quickly adapted and became the main developer on the hp.io project, a global Developer Portal aimed at users worldwide. I work with a range of technologies, including PHP, Drupal 10, Node.js, MySQL, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, jQuery, Apigee, REST APIs, Docker & Docksal, Acquia, Git, and GitFlow.

      On a daily basis, I develop new features based on our sprint activities and address critical bugs. I actively participate in Agile methodologies and ceremonies such as daily stand-ups, planning meetings, demos, and retrospectives. My work primarily involves enhancing the project using Drupal 10 with PHP 8.2 for the back-end, along with front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and React with Vite. This project also includes some custom workarounds where Drupal renders React components.

      Although I initially had no experience with Drupal, my extensive PHP background enabled me to quickly gain expertise in the Drupal core. I am now considered one of the most important developer on the project, just below the development lead, and continue to contribute significantly to both the development and operational success of hp.io.`,

    description:
      "This was my first professional project, developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL. It involved creating a wide range of custom functionalities from scratch, such as a logged-in user area, data scraping to gather information from the Habbo Hotel website, a news section, and a forum with features like comments, likes, moderation, and rankings. The project also included a pixel art gallery where registered users could rate artworks, as well as a user profile section with customizable widgets, similar to the original Habbo Home from Habbo Hotel. This project provided a comprehensive experience in full-stack development, integrating both front-end and back-end solutions.",
